This repository contains solutions to various Codeforces problems, organized by problem rating levels. Each problem is stored in its own folder, and inside each folder, there is a description file that provides detailed information about the problem and the solution approach.

Repository Structure:

Problem Folders: Each folder corresponds to a specific problem and includes the following:

    a. Problem Statement: Link to the problem.
    
    b. Approach Used: An explanation of the approach taken to solve the problem.
    
    c. Algorithm & Time Complexity: A breakdown of the algorithm used and its time complexity analysis.

This structure allows for easy navigation through the different problems, providing not just the code but also an understanding of the thought process and algorithmic steps involved in solving each problem.
