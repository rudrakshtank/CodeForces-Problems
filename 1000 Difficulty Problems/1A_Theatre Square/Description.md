~Approach: The problem involves calculating how many tiles of size a x a are required to cover a rectangular area of size n x m. The approach is based on dividing the total dimensions by the tile's side and rounding up, as the area might not be perfectly divisible.

~Algorithm Used:
1. First, calculate the number of tiles required along the length of the rectangle (n). Since the tile is of size a, the number of tiles needed is the ceiling of n / a. This is computed using (n + a - 1) / a, which ensures rounding up when there's any remainder.
2. Similarly, calculate the number of tiles required along the width (m) using (m + a - 1) / a.
3. The total number of tiles required is the product of the number of tiles along the length and width: total_flag = flag * flagw.

~Time Complexity: O(1); The algorithm only involves basic arithmetic operations (addition, division, and multiplication), all of which take constant time.

Since the algorithm runs in constant time, it is very efficient and handles any input size quickly.
